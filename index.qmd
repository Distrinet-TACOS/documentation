subtitle: "Practical Trusted Execution of Mixed-Criticality Code"

abstract: |
    Industry 4.0 is increasingly using commodity hardware and software
    in place of dedicated control systems to lower costs and increase
    flexibility. However, this means that critical control code
    must compete for resources with an increasingly complex software
    stack that exposes a new attack surface. The Mixed Criticality
    Trusted Execution Environment (Mr-TEE) tackles this problem at
    its root, by delivering availability for safety-critical control code,
    while running untrusted applications in a minimally modified Linux
    stack. This is achieved by providing a real-time scheduler and novel
    peripheral sharing system in the Secure World. Mr-TEE hence provides
    the best of both worlds for Industry 4.0 developers, ensuring
    the trusted execution of time-sensitive control applications,
    while minimizing design effort and restrictions for untrusted applications.
    Evaluation on an Arm TrustZone-enabled Cortex MCU
    demonstrates a worst-case overhead of 1.88% to support real-time
    scheduling in the TEE.

This is the documentation for Mr-TEE, presented in the paper ["Mr-TEE: Practical Trusted Execution of Mixed-Criticality Code"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626562.3626831). It explains the details of a TEE implementation that provides hardware isolation and real-time execution of safety-critical applications for Cyber-Physical systems, while transparantly sharing peripherals with little developer overhead.

Mr-TEE has also been presented at FOSDEM 2023: ["Keeping safety-critical programs alive when Linux isnâ€™t able to"](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/cc_mrtee/).
